TUESDAY

- [x] Ask Emily about whether or not we want to give them the option to see artifacts in their choice of order, or if they should follow a predetermined path
- [x] ask for feedback on the experience so far
- [x] ask about interview contact process (share ideas on how who to ask and how to best do so)
- [x] Do voiceover/podcast style option in addition to text?? No
- [x] confirm Emily and Cedric's job titles (in the credits section)

Make the topic/theme:
- a day in the life of an artifact; what would they have heard? what sounds did they make? plus featured interviews
- ie: chose geographic over temporal for the trolleybus, for the train car will do temporal; is that alright with you?

Meeting Notes
- Natural resources and industrial technologies
Sharon Babian - curator of transportation


*****images of the artifacts on the choices page
- check website for photos? Emily will ask Pierre if he has any more
- condensed version of content? how much time do people need to read it?
- move the links to the top for the audios; move text to the bottom
- IPOT - ideas people objects - so for every artifact, having multiple interpretation entrie points coming through either of those three - physical (about a place, size, environmental, etc.)


**re community
- proceed and if not able to develop connections we can drop community piece
- best practices: using email is best, connection to Ingenium; the GWF; samples of what it is so far; describe project, what the request is and what the expectation is, how much time I'm expecting from them; being open for feedback, etc.; if they agree then a consent form
- cc emily if the community has questions
- potentially offer museum passes? check with Emily/Anna
- interviews aren't paid, and so especially accomodating of their schedules (doing it evenings, weekends, etc.) **stipulate outright that it's not paid**


Emily interview - January
- will check with Sharon first
- would be helpful for curators, etc. to come up with one main question


Artifact handlers:
- their jobs was to move all of those pieces; when handling this artifact what do they need to be mindful of?
- what's involved with moving the artifact when you can't drive it?


Conservators
- how best to preserve this type of artifact?
- what is the material of the artifact tell us about the time or the people?


Curator
- what's significant about this piece?
- what does evidence/reading the artifact? materiality? material culture of this piece?
- what's significant about the materiality of this piece?
