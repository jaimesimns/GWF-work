it works!! for local file types.

Otherwise can use Google Drive embedding (kabob->open file in new tab; kabob -> embed), youtube if has a video attached, or soundcloud (embed)

Need to ask Sam which version is better; also ask about transcripts
- is it better to have a button that links to a transcript, or to just paste the transcript below? (if pasting below, does that mean that screen readers have to read through all the text to get to the bottom?)
