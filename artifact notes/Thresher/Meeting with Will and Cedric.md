# Meeting with William Knight, CÃ©dric Brosseau, & Emily Gann
### Nov. 15, 2021, about the thresher
interview recorded on phone voice recorder

Qs
2. Patents, art
3. This was made in Hamilton, what was the reach of the sale of these?
4. Were they mass produced?
5. Named the "Peerless," can you tell us anything about the name?
6. Or the maintenance tools attached?
7. Horse shoe/straw hat on another one of these? for good luck?


==Answers==

Thresher needs power, provided by steam traction engine
- sound of that or gasoline tractor
- thresher itself
- people working and talking, horse teams nearby

archival image research about threshing teams; custom combining/custom threshing
teams would go out on contract and thresh the grain
the machine itself has wooden chain, threshing required a lot of people
people are bagging


can video search for threshing

the grain was cut with binder and cut in sheaves and elft to dry; threshing crew would come in and would go from farm to farm to farm

soundscape
machine being pulled into field like train or parade with machine and followed by [word] to haul water, wood, etc.

...
machine would have been set in centreal area of field for sheaves to 
would have set up giant belt from flywheel on thresher to steamer; wobbling of belt
crews go around with horse and wagon and bringing sheaves 


the machiene breaks sheaves apart and draws it in, cuts rope, ......

seperates 


one or two people bagging the 40lb bags, shafts blown out back


involved a lot of people; mostly men
women only as cooks, probably foremen or owners wives



central threshing place and belt is 20-30 feet, so sound change from central area
chaff blown/heaped into big pile
different work crews at any moment

messy work; wind blowing and machine makes lots of noise and air; lots of dust

end of summer-fall; August through September
crews would start in US and move north, bc grain matures earlier at lower altitudes?
environment changes as it goes

**check catalogue record re: owner? may be unknown

Western Development Museum had a journal based on Alberta?
crews could be super local but could also travel

in prairies, might have local crews bc of farm sizes; in smaller areas like Ontario a bunch of farmers would collaborate

definitely seasonal but very important
most crews illiterate bc MANUAL LABOUR



visual language
- patents
- selling like scientific instrument versus the skills of people working in (is skilled labour, but not in the learned traditional sense)



would have had engineer to run the steam tractor, so would have done maintenance on machines


what would go wrong most often?
- the belt might break, screens, look into mechanical analysis with Ryan Manson? has restored threshers; or guy down in PEI - Old PEI Farm Guy
- he has a threshing machine that we have in the collection
- William Knight has email: 

many videos on youtube
George White thresher in Ingenium channel - metal but good for knowledge

straw hat as in 'throw the hat in' into the machine to celebrate the end?
the Deonne? 

- people modifying the things they use of part of their use for various reasons?
- signs of human intervention with technology
- is horseshoe worn?

delmine door



also patents, re: scientific development



Can I contact them for the oral history part?
Will:  can talk about patent (English preferred)
Cedric: can talk about operations; asphalt shingles added later on for waterproofing (look into when it was added on); (English and French)



** world record of most threshing machines operating at once; trying to beat them

Peerless is the model name; they have trade lit in the library - catalogue (2), stamps for the thresher man?; 
- report on threshers done by Franz (France?) 19670835
