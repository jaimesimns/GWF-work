Threshers separate or "thresh" grain from the head. They also separate  
grain kernels from the straw and chaff, cleaning the grain. Threshers were  
first developed in Europe in the late 18th century and mechanized the  
separation of grain, which was previously done by hand with tools such as  
flails. The first threshing machines were stationary: powered by hand or  
treadmill, they increased the amount of grain a farmer could separate in a  
day. Wheeled threshing machines began to replace stationary threshers in  
the 1860s and further mechanized grain harvesting. Threshers were initially  
built of wood and powered by horse-powered windlasses; they were later  
built of steel and powered by steam traction engines and gas tractors.  
Threshers were in turn replaced through the twentieth century by combine  
harvesters, which merged harvesting and threshing operations in one  
machine.  
  
The Sawyer Massey company of Hamilton, Ontario produced road-building  
equipment, reapers, mowers, separators, horse powers, and beginning in the  
early 1880s, steam traction engines. Prior to 1892, the company was known  
as the L.D. Sawyer Co. In 1892, the Massey brothers acquired an interest in  
the company and it was renamed the Sawyer & Massey Company. In 1910, the  
Masseys divested their holding and the company then became known as  
Sawyer-Massey. Sawyer-Massey continued to produce threshers and steam  
traction engines, and later manufactured gasoline-powered tractors.  
  
Wheeled threshing machines were first introduced in the 1860s. Replacing  
stationary ground threshers, they further mechanized grain harvesting and  
increased the amount of grain a farmer could process in a day. Initially  
powered by horse power, threshers were later powered by steam traction  
engines and gas tractors. The Peerless Separator was first introduced in  
1887; it featured new grain separating technology, which used vibrating  
decks to separate grain from straw. This later model also features a  
self-feeder, technology that was introduced in the 1890s. Self-feeders  
automatically cut tied grain bundles and fed them into the thresher at a  
steady rate. They also allowed a greater volume of grain to be threshed in  
the machine.  Powered by traction engines, and later tractors, these types  
of threshers were gradually replaced in the mid 20th century by combine  
harvesters, which merged reaping and threshing operations in one  
self-propelled machine. This object represents the trend in late 19th  
century threshers to further automation in grain separation; it also  
represents the consolidation of Canadian agricultural-equipment  
manufacturing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  
  
1997 condition notes:  
Stable Comments:  Closer examination of roofing materials and interior  
surfaces are needed to ascertain long term stability. :: Deterioration  
Notes:  In general, artifact is in poor condition. Heavy dirt accretion and  
grime overall, particularly adjacent to hardware and in recessed areas.  
Feeder has shifted and leans down towards the proper rt side. Heavy iron  
oxide corrosion is present on all ferrous components with some loss and  
perforations in areas, particularly on the grain handling device on the  
proper lt side. Wood is checked, split, abraded, and stained (tide lines),  
with some dimensional changes and loss. Wood surfaces adjacent to hardware  
and moving parts are stained due to previous applications of lubricant.  
Paint is powdery, has faded, oxidized, and exhibits some loss, although  
most painted surfaces are still legible. Leather and fabric belting are  
abraded, fraying, and grimy. Some parts are no longer attached. Straw and  
other organic debris is found inside.

Painted surface on one side is faded and weathered to pinkish white where  
still present. Area where hinges protected from weathering dirty but red  
paint still visible. Other side is semi-gloss red with some surface losses  
down to level of wood and others to lighter matte red.  
Three major cracks. Two on one side (17cm and 10cm long) and one (25cm) on  
the opposing side.  
8 screws for hinges still present. Metal bracket with corroded iron nails  
on one edge.  
Diagonal piece jutting out at acute angle from red side has rough surface  
along edge where losses have occurred.
