Powershovel  
Reviewed by AA, 11 May 2018: To keep all parts. The boom, the dipper, the  
bucket, and the smokestack are all important pieces of the shovel. Even  
though the boom and the dipper are cover in clay, they need to be  
preserved. The arrangement of the boom and the dipper actually indicate  
that this artifact is a power shovel rather than another piece of earth  
moving equipment.  
  
The shovel is dated to the 1920s, but the boiler is from 1945. The  
equipment was made in Erie, PA not in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The  
location is noted on the boom, although it is hardly accessible at the  
moment. There are also serial numbers on the boom: Y3341, Y3333.
