In front of you is the Type B-3 steam shovel #841168, manufactured in the 1920s by Bucyrus-Erie of South Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

“Basic earth moving machine during the steam era. Steam excavating equipment was first used in late 1790s, and an early shovel was patented by Otis in 1839. The machines were used predominantly in mid to late 19th century, and early 20t century. Bycyrus erie, established in 1880, was an important manufacturer of surface and underground mining equipment. Was purchased by Caterpillar in 1997.”

The B-3 could be used for ditching, lifting, or as an extraction shovel, as it came with several attachments including a crane, dragline, and clamshell. The clamshell can still be seen at the back of the powershovel, and is caked in ---------.

It was used as a mining excavator by Haley Industries of Renfrew, Ontario until the 1960s, likely serving in one of their quarries.

(Came from 61 quarry road, Renfrew, ON)

The powershovel is 5.8 meters long, 3.5 meters wide, 3.9 m tall, and weighs over 30,000 kg.

"The Bucyrus-Erie B-3 steam shovel is part of a vanishing breed of workhorses that helped shape industrialized America. Details of its parentage remain somewhat obscure; it probably was born during the post-Depression era. It was delivered to Morrison-Knudsen in 1931 at a cost of $9,350.

The B-3 destined for permanent display at ITD, began life as a coal-fired, single-shaft steam shovel that runs on tracks similar to those on military tanks. It probably was used in railroad and irrigation canal construction and maintenance in southwestern Idaho, says C.W. Smilie Anderson, a longtime M-K engineer.

Equipment operators sat in a wooden box, known as a “house,” that closely resembles a wooden railroad caboose. The bucket at the opposite end of the long arm is capable of taking bites of seven-eights of a yard. The original equipment was modified to run on compressed air when it was assigned to excavation in tunnels to avoid accumulations of exhaust fumes.

Powershovel 

Reviewed by AA, 11 May 2018: To keep all parts. The boom, the dipper, the 

bucket, and the smokestack are all important pieces of the shovel. Even 

though the boom and the dipper are cover in clay, they need to be 

preserved. The arrangement of the boom and the dipper actually indicate 

that this artifact is a power shovel rather than another piece of earth 

moving equipment. 

The shovel is dated to the 1920s, but the boiler is from 1945. The 

equipment was made in Erie, PA not in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The 

location is noted on the boom, although it is hardly accessible at the 

moment. There are also serial numbers on the boom: Y3341, Y3333.
