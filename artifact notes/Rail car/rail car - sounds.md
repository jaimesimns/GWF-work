## SOUNDS
1854 - 1907: horse drawn, and then early locomotive with a wood burning engine
- add steamer sounds in; water splashing; people and animals
1907: shut down, car is idle? maybe used on a different line?
1914-1915: slid across the ice
1915-1973: storage shed on farm
- agricultural farm; looks like it was a shed in their front/side yard or field, so car sounds?
1973: moved to museum
