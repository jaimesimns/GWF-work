In front of you is one of the oldest pieces of rolling stock (railway equipment) in Canada. Built in 1854 by Carmichael & Brown of Montreal, Quebec, it is also the only known specimen of broad gauge equipment in Canada. 

==[explain about broad versus narrow gauge; East-West and diff than Americans; broad gage versus standard track which canada originally went with for east-west growth and bc different than america bc of threat of american invasion; switched 1890s?]==

The rail car served both passenger and freight, with the first third of the car devoted to passengers and the latter two thirds for freight. If you look inside the car, you can see a wooden partial division, which marked the bounds of a smoking room (the area for passengers). 

The rail car likely worked for the Carillon and Grenville Railway, a twelve-mile railroad on the shores of the Ottawa River. The railway served as a way to comfortably travel between steamboat landings, as steamboats were unable to pass the rapids in the area, which necessitated a land route as an intermediary between two steamboats. 

The railway disolved and resolved multiple times under different owners, before shutting down in 1907. The tracks were later used by a variety of other railway companies. The next concrete mention of the railcar is in the winter of 1914 to 1915, when "an old wooden railway coach, its trucks and undercarriage removed, was slid across the ice from Carillon, Quebec, over the frozen Ottawa River to Chute Ã  Blondeau, Ontario" (Seton, 1990). For the next sixty years, the rail car served as a storage shed for the St-Denis family on their farm.

The rail car (turned shed) was acquired by the museum on Nov. 2, 1973 from R. St-Denis, for the price of a replacement shed. 

The roof was recovered with tin at some point during its life, but you can still find traces of its original finish on the door frames. It may have had one of its side doors added later, as well as its roof joists. The rail car is 14.15 meters long, 3.50 meters wide, and 3.20 meters tall.

## SOUNDS
This soundscape explores the rail car's life, beginning with its time on the Carillon and Grenville Rail, and then its life after. Use the sounds to guess where the rail car went after its fifty-three years on the railway, and then read the history to find out if you're correct! For the soundscape, one second of audio is the same as one year of the rail car's life.

1854 - 1907: horse drawn, and then early locomotive with a wood burning engine
1907: shut down, car is idle? maybe used on a different line?
1914-1915: slid across the ice
1915-1973: storage shed on farm
- agricultural farm; looks like it was a shed in their front/side yard, so car sounds?
