Wreath Press, 2012.0041:  
This wreath press was created in 1960 by a Christmas tree producer from  
Lunenburg County,  
Nova Scotia. Farmers grow and harvest Christmas trees across Canada, but  
Lunenburg County is  
a particularly significant area for Christmas tree production.    Nova  
Scotia has exported  
Christmas trees since the 1920s.  
Lunenberg county has been exporting Christmas trees to the American market  
since the 1910s.  
At its peak, in the 1950s,  
The Christmas tree industry has narrow-profit margins and producers strive  
to reduce production  
costs. Making wreaths from tree trimmings help increase revenue, while the  
press, which  
compacted the wreaths for shipping, helped the farmer save fuel costs.
