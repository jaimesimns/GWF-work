The artifact you see in front of you is CCF-Brill T44 trolleybus #4042, one of the only surviving Brill trolleybusses that served Montreal from 1937 to 1966.

The #4042 was made by the Canadian Car & Foundry Co., Ltd. of Fort William, Ontario in 1947. It was released into service in December 1947 until its retirement in April 1966. Used for the purpose of public transport, it is an example of the last electric-powered surface transit vehicle to operate in Montreal. The trolleycar is 12 metres long, 2.8 metres wide, and 3.1 metres tall.

The trolleybus ran route #26, which was 'rue Beaubien - 12e Ave.' The route led from the corner of rue Beaubien Est. and 12e Ave., ran down rue Beaubien Est to where it met Saint-Laurent Blvd., and then headed down Saint-Laurent Blvd. to run a loop along Saint-Laurent, Rue Bernard Ouest, Park Ave., and Saint-Viateur Ouest.

Trolleybusses were used in Montréal from 1937 to 1966. On March 29, 1937, the Montreal Tramways Company put seven electric-powered trolleybusses into service to create one of the first trolleybus services in Canada. Rue Beaubien Est. was one of the earliest trolleybus routes.

The system later expanded to Amherst St., Christophe-Colob Ave., and Belanger St. in 1949. Forty more trolleybusses were acquired and released into service that same year, eventually increasing to 105 trolleybusses by 1952. In 1951, public transit became the responsibility of the municipality, and Montréal chose to replace the trolleybus system with free-range busses, which required less infrastructure and were more flexible in their routes. The trolleybus era slowly came to an end after that.

After Montréal's retirement of the trolleybus system in 1966, most trolleybusses were sent to Mexico City to serve out the rest of their life. CCF-Brill T44 trolleybus #4042 was given to the Canadian Railway Historical Association, which put it on display at the Canadian Railway Museum in Delson, QC. The trolleybus resided there until 1983, when it came to the Canada Science and Technology Museum (now under the Ingenium umbrella) as part of a trade.

An image of the Montreal Tramways trolleybus routes, circa 1966 (the last year of service). Note the 26 Beaubien route, running from a loop down St. Laurent Blvd along Rue St. Viateur O, Park Ave, and Rue Bernard O. A list of where the trolleybusses were sent is available in the bottom left-hand corner. Many busses were sold to Mexico City, where they ran for several more years, but #4042 was given to the CRHA, also known as the Canadian Railway Historical Association, which is how it ended up at the Canadian Railway Museum before coming to Ingenium.

"Montreal Public Transit Trolleybuses 1937: Seven trolleybuses, electrically powered, were put into service on Beaubien St. in Montreal on March 29, 1937. It was the first modern trolleybus service in Canada and ten years later the MTC acquired 40 more. They rolled along Beaubien St. and starting in 1949, on Amherst St. and Christophe-Colomb Avenue. They deployed another 40 trolleybuses in 1949 on Belanger St. and by 1952, the number of trolleybuses increased from 80 to 105 – but then remained unchanged until the system ended in 1966."[2]
