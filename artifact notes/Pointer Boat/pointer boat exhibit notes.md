T1 Object Name:

Cockburn Pointer Boat or Lumberman’s Bateau

T2 Headline:

· The pointer boat – le bonne in Quebec – was the log-driving boat of the river men for over 150 years.

· Every spring log-drivers used boats like this to help move thousands of logs down the rivers of eastern Canada from remote forests to collection points where workers prepared them to be transported to markets around the world.

T3 Main Message:

This is a rare example of a full-sized pointer boat. Crews of as many as eight men, used boats like this to sweep the river banks and shallows and re-float any logs hung up there. These boats seldom lasted more than ten years and often as little as one work season on the river. Remarkably, this boat did survive to tell its story.

Look carefully at it and imagine the frigid, roaring waters of the Ottawa River in early spring. Think about the crew using the oars to manoeuver into shore against the rushing current and the rocks to hook and move a log out into the river. Sometimes they had to drag the boat over rocks or portages to get to stranded logs. Crew and boat worked as a well-tuned machine moving expertly in and out of the shallows, turning on a dime, again and again.

Every scar and rough repair on this boat is evidence of the brutal environment in which log-drivers worked and the harsh realities of their daily lives. The pointer boat allows us to document and celebrate the great skill and hard work of the people who built and used these boats for over 150 years.

Additional background information (for photo caption?)

From the early 1800s, logging was the mainstay of the regional economy and these boats helped make it practical and profitable to extract logs from areas where there were no roads or railways.

This pointer boat was built by third generation boat-builder John A. Cockburn using the design developed by his grandfather in the 1850s following the example of the transport bateaux of New France. Pointers were easy to manoeuver even with one oar. Their nearly flat bottoms and shallow draft meant that they could float in any amount of water (“a heavy dew”) and that crews could drag them over obstacles and portages. They were easy to build and therefore relatively cheap; log drives were very hard on boats and they had to be replaced frequently.
