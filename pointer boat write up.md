Built around 1900, the Cockburn boat was a pointer-style (descript) vessel used in the timber trade to help float logs down the Ottawa River. The boat was designed and manufactured by John A. Cockburn of Pembroke, Ontario.

The boat was painted red, with large black lettering that read: “John A. Cockburn / Pembroke”

Size: 966 cm long, 165 cm wide, 114 cm high

Wood with metal fittings and galvanized metal sheeting to reinforce bow and stern; wooden oars

Had heavy usage; was clearly a working boat – the bottom recovered with galvanized iron sheathing that is still worn through, tar/pitch reapplied on the inside, worn paint, many replaced smaller fittings, planks, etc.
