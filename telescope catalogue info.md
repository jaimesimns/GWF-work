1974.0488

manufacture: Warner and Swasey Co., c. 1905, Cleveland, OH, USA
refracting/equatorial telescope

transfer from dominion observatory in 1974

see email

To observe celestial objects & phenomenon. This telescope was used for  
astronomical research at the Dominion Observatory & later for public  
education there.  
  
Canada: A major piece of the original equipment of the Dominion  
Observatory, it played an important role in the early astronomical research  
done in Canada, & later was extensively used in public education  
programmes.  
  
technical info: Telescope which had optics made by a premier optician of  
the time & mounting also made by one of the best manufacturers of the time.  
It was one of the largest refracting telescopes in the world when it was  
built. The original 15" doublet was unusual as flint element placed ahead  
of crown - supposed to help reduce condensation problems.  
  
Ottawa, ON, Can  
  
Used at the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa (1905-1974). Used in CSTM public  
programming from 1975 to 2014 and located in the Helen Sawyer Hogg  
Observatory until it was removed and observatory dismantled in 2016

CR_Text= -the problem with the telescope was the axis of the hour angle had  
tightened up. the problem was two small "4" dia. bronze wheels that are  
used to take some of the weight of the telescope off of the main  
bearings'"of the hour angle axis. These two bronze rollers will be referred  
as support rollers. These rollers were adjusted too tight against the  
telescope causing the rollers to mushroom at the edges and therefore  
seizing up the rollers. the casing for the support rollers was also pushed  
up against the gear causing extra friction. This also was caused by over  
tightening of the support rollers  
What Was Done:  
  
  
the support rollers were loosened off by the adjuster screw. Then the burrs  
were ground off of the mushroomed edges of the two bronze rollers with an  
electric Dremel tool and the rollers were unseized. the Support rollers and  
Telescope were then cleaned off with a dry rag. Then the rollers were  
greased with bearing grease and the roller pins were oi1ed with SAE 30  
non-detergent  oil. the support rollers were then readjusted to the proper  
tension by using the adjuster screw. the rollers now move properly and the  
roller easing clears the gear eliminating the extra friction. In will keep  
a close eye on the repairs during  
my weekly maintenance check of the telescope.  
  
  
What needs to be done in the near future:  
At the soonest convenient time the support rollers are going to have to be  
removed and new wheels are going to have to be machined and reinstalled.  
This can be done by using a crane to lift and support the telescope. You  
first have to disconnect all gears and drives to prevent them from getting  
damaged. Then support the telescope with the crane and then unbolt the  
bearings for the hour angle axis. Now lift up telescope about 6" and remove  
the support bearings. After the support bearing are removed lower the  
telescope back down and bolt down the hour angle axis bearing again. the  
same procedure should be used for reinstalling of the new rollers after  
they  are machined. the new rollers cannot be machined until the old  
rollers are removed from the telescope and carefully inspected. the rollers  
should be machined in a maximum of two days.  
  
  
Estimated time:  
  
  
the estimated time is two to three weeks  
During these few weeks we will need a crane for two separate days for  
approx. 4 hrs each time max.  
Also needed when the crane is here is 2 other helpers.  
  
  
  
  
Additional Work Performed (date unknown)  
  
  
What was done: (addition)  
This morning In checked the support rollers and found the support roller  
casing rubbing against the gear. In loosened off the support rollers. In  
then made a small shim out of hard wood (maple) .In put the shim into the  
support roller casing and then tightened up the support rollers to the  
right tension. the telescope should be alright for now. In will keep a  
close eye on the support rollers during my maintenance once a week.

CR_Date=02/28/1992  
CR_Text= It was reported by Jacques Lebrecque, in a memo dated 24.2.92 that  
the telescope was very hard to turn in a manual mode about the hour circle  
and also that the powered slewing motion (used to make small adjustments  
when tracking an object) was scarcely effective in one direction.  
the telescope was inspected by H. Ballard (25.2.92) and also by D. Elliott  
w/H. Ballard (27.2.92) and additional lubrication was added to the locking  
collar for the hour circle. the telescope was swung through several 180  
degree arcs to distribute the oil and found to travel with acceptable  
freedom. the locking action was tested and also found to be acceptable.  
Harvey recently had disassembled the locking mechanism for the purpose of  
cleaning, adjustment and lubrication and it appears that the problem  
reported was simply the result of too little lubrication upon reassembly.  
On the subject of the problem with the slewing motion, Harvey was already  
aware of the problem and is already working on the solution  with the  
assistance of the SAT Electronics Department.  
  
  
When the original clockwork driving mechanism was changed to electric  
motors, the new system utilized two electric motors, both synchronous, one  
powering the normal tracking function and a second that, through a  
mechanical mechanism, superimposes a slewing or adjustment capability on  
top of the normal tracking function.  
  
  
After eliminating other possible causes, it was determined that the slewing  
problem is caused by substandard performance of this "slewing" motor. It  
was removed and bench tested and although it does not exhibit obvious  
problems its power output is marginal at best. On the recommendation of Cec  
Murray (Chief, Electronics Division), a non-synchronous motor of the same  
nominal output and compatible with the mounting bracket has been ordered to  
replace the original. the slewing motion does not require a synchronous  
motor as the slewing action is not time dependent and the natural  
characteristics of a non-synchronous  motor should provide for  
significantly greater torque. It is expected that the change to the new  
motor will correct the problem.  
  
  
Unfortunately the new motor is special order and is not expected in until  
approximately May 92'. The actual repair will only take about an hour and  
will be done as soon as it is received. the slewing action possibly is  
somewhat weather (room temperature) dependent so its action may improve  
with warmer weather. It also improves a bit with "exercise". In any case  
operators will have to persevere until May!.  
  
  
  
  
Added Feb 28, 1992  
  
  
A recurring complaint has been reported concerning the operation of the  
telescope on an irregular basis for many years.  
  
  
the problem involves the locking mechanism that engages the tracking  
function of the telescope. This consists of a grooved collar with an  
accompanying yoke in which is fixed a small wedge that corresponds in shape  
to the grooved collar. By forcing the wedge into the collar, driving motion  
is transferred to the telescope tube. This locking mechanism is a very  
fine piece of machine design and a linear motion of approximately .003" is  
all that is required to achieve lock-up.  
  
  
the original locking action was applied by a system of manually operated  
shafts and gears. At an earlier date this manual system was replaced with a  
powered equivalent. Unfortunately, the new system, as built, does not  
provide for built-in adjustment and a review of the maintenance records  
would suggest that the limit of travel on the system is marginally on the  
short side.  
  
  
the common complaint is that the tracking action does not engage positively  
(i.e. it slips) or that when not engaged, the telescope does not move  
freely when swung by hand (i.e. it drags). Due to the lack of provision for  
built-in adjustment, changes have been made on several occasions by  
physically bending one of the connecting linkages in the locking system.  
One must remember that improvement on one condition causes a deterioration  
of the other with  the present arrangement, therefore, adjustment by this  
means is at best a delicate balancing act. In any case, this is a very  
crude, unprofessional solution to the problem and recurring complaints show  
that it is not a permanent one.  
  
  
In suggest that a permanent solution be achieved by fabricating new  
components, as necessary to achieve two objectives:  
(a) built-in adjustment capability  
(b) increased travel range on locking mechanism with adjustable travel  
control limits  
  
  
the original components and earlier replacement components that would not  
feature in the new design would be properly documented and sent to storage.  
No parts would be reused, if that entailed making modifications to them,  
thereby ensuring reversibility to the existing (as received) layout.  
  
  
A preliminary suggestion, requiring further detailing, can be found on a  
corresponding treatment proposal. Cost of materials and manpower  
requirements should be quite low. In would estimate that about a week is  
required to  fabricate new pieces with most material in stock, followed by  
a day of test and adjustment. the work should be scheduled to coincide with  
the summer break in the Astronomy Program (i.e. June if possible).  
  
  
For the present, the locking mechanism is performing reasonably well. In  
strongly recommend, that no further "tampering" be done until the above  
work can be performed as permanent damage is being done to the components  
involved..  
  
  
Condition requiring solution: recurring adjustment requirement on  
hour-angle locking device (i.e. tracking mechanism).  
  
  
Refer to condition Report 28.2.92 for description of problem. Several  
possible solutions were identified in discussion with H. Ballard. There are  
two likely ways to go. One method would be to increase the travel range of  
the locking device by physically lengthening the driving screw.  
Additionally, reference adjustment could be incorporated within the  
existing linkage arrangement. A second method of increasing the travel  
range of the  locking device would be to fabricate new lead screw  
components with a faster (i.e. coarser pitch) feed rate. Again, reference  
adjustment could be incorporated in the linkage.  
  
  
In personally, favour the first method, which could be achieved by  
fabricating a new motor mount (for the locking motor), extending the lead  
screw on the driving motor gearbox by a factor of two, fabricating sundry  
brackets for lead screw support and provision of adjustable limit switch  
mounting and modification of linkage components to allow fine reference  
adjustments.  
  
  
As no drawings exist of the powered locking system, provision of a detailed  
design on paper would take a significant amount of time. This is not really  
necessary as In recommend that original pieces not be modified, rather that  
they be replaced if they cannot serve in their present configuration.  
At the appropriate time, the locking mechanism will be removed as necessary  
to the shop and a new mount and related fixtures made directly from the  
original, using it as a pattern for attachment locations and configuration.  
A rough idea of what In envisage is sketched below. In estimate that it  
will take a day for disassembly/design, one week for fabrication and a day  
or two for application/testing/adjustment. Almost all material should be in  
stock and is minimal in any case.  
  
  
Work would be scheduled during summer break in Astronomy Program and as  
other shop priorities dictate.

*Annual cleaning and servicing performed as follows;  
- entire telescope vacuumed, assisted by manual brushing in hard to reach  
areas (as necessary)  
- there were isolated spots of lubricant on various parts of the tube,  
especially near the central pivot; these were removed with a rag, lightly  
dampened with Varsol  
- the desiccant in the upper end of the tube was exchanged and should be  
good for at least a month or more  
- all excess lubrication was removed from the vicinity of the motion work  
with brush and rags; Varsol was used sparingly (as necessary)  
- the motion work was freshly lubricated with Tellus 32 oil; surprisingly,  
the differential drive system, providing the slewing action, appears to be  
noisier after the servicing; we observed it carefully for an extended  
period of time and redid the lubrication several times; it would be a good  
idea to keep an eye of this area in the near future, to make sure that  
there is no problem with it  
- all gearing, both  in the motion work and external, was given a fresh  
application of lithium grease on the tooth faces  
- the tube pivots and related brackets(having greased fittings) were all  
greased with cup grease applied by grease gun using temporary grease  
fittings previously made by Harvey Ballard  
- some surface rusting had occurred on the central portion of the main tube  
pivot shaft as a result of periodic roof leakage; this was removed with  
#600 wet & dry sandpaper and oil, followed by fine Scotchbrite and oil; the  
shaft was then degreased with Varsol and a coat of microcrystalline wax was  
applied  
- for the time being, polyethylene sheeting was draped over the portion of  
the telescope under the shutter leak; the facilities trouble desk was  
notified about the problem and a description of the problem was given (it  
appears that besides the usual problems with the shutter skirting, there is  
a leaking joint in the upper shutter section, between the two upper most  
pieces; there is probably a gasket  between the two panels and it likely  
has failed; unless the panels are disassembled...big job...the only fix is  
to clean the area thoroughly and apply fresh caulking to the outside  
- while working on the motion work, it was noted that the forward relay of  
the RA slewing mechanism was coated in excess lubricant; as a result it  
appears that the operation is faulty; the slewing action works OK if you  
toggle back and forth from forward to reverse but it will not operate in  
the forward direction only if repeated successively; the SAT electronics  
department was advised and they will clean the relays with contact cleaner  
and test the operation afterwards  
- the heater in the pedestal base was unplugged for the summer months  
- nitrogen was admitted to the tube and lens cavity (as per usual  
servicing); the gas cylinder is about half consumed but should last for the  
better part of the summer  
- the floor of the dome was vacuumed and the portable stairwells used in  
the servicing wiped down after  use  
- the focussing mechanism was thoroughly degreased with Varsol and a light  
coat of Tellus 32 oil was applied to both the tube and the rack; the  
mechanism is once again operating smoothly and freely  
- the slip ring on the normal eyepiece used was tightened up to prevent it  
from drooping  
- when changing the desiccant in the upper tube, it was noticed that the  
objective lens appear to be extremely dirty; no attempt was made to clean  
them as this is a job for someone with special knowledge and training; the  
subject of cleaning the lens had been recently raised by the curator,  
Randall Brooks, and in conversation with him, it was decided that he will  
get in touch with Jacques Labrecque concerning having him perform this  
task; it was suggested that Lyness Jones would be a good person to have  
assist Jacques in the work and he has expressed interest in helping;  
Randall would like to have the operation video-taped so the we have it  
recorded for posterity so that others may be able to perform the task in  
future, when those that presently are qualified are gone; Randall will  
arrange for the taping; I would recommend that myself and perhaps the other  
members of the Restoration Section observe at least parts of the operation  
so that we will have a better understanding of what is involved and so that  
we may possibly be candidates to perform the task in future; assuming that  
Jacques is interested and up to the job, the work will be tentatively  
scheduled for the first two weeks of June It should be noted that there is  
additional surface rusting on various components of the tube and degree  
wheels. Once the shutter mechanism has been repaired satisfactorily, it  
would be a good idea to spend some additional time on these areas to remove  
this rust and apply a protective coating.

*Cleaning of the 15" telescope lens was undertaken by Jacques Labrecque,  
Randall Brooks and volunteer Lyness Jones. This operation had not been done  
since 1984, due to the delicate  nature of the operation and the fact that  
minor amounts of dirt on the lens do not necessarily impede the present  
kind of operation that the telescope is used for. It should be emphasized  
that the lens are very delicate and easily susceptible to damage and that  
is why Mr. Labrecque (who has much experience in this area) was called upon  
to lead this exercise. In view of the fact that Mr. Labrecque is getting on  
in years, it was decided that it would be wise to do a cleaning at this  
time, even though the lens were not causing any particular problem for  
operation. Based upon closer inspection, once the objective lens unit had  
been removed, a decision would be taken whether or not to further  
disassemble the lens package and clean each individual element. In the end  
it was decided that there wasn't sufficient contamination in the interior  
cavities to warrant the much greater work involved in disassembling this  
unit and then realigning it after treatment. the responsible curator,  
Randall  Brooks, has subsequently produced a very thorough instruction  
brief on the lens cleaning procedure and this has been inserted in this  
dossier in the maintenance section. As Randall mentions in these  
instructions, a video tape was made during the course of the treatment and  
copies are in the supplementary file and also in the Conservation Division.  
Although the treatment done has in large part been covered in the brief, I  
will record it here once more but from the perspective of volunteer, Lyness  
Jones, who assisted in the operation and who was asked to take notes as  
well.  
the step by step procedure for cleaning the lens follows:  
  
  
*the telescope tube was tilted down to shoulder height, pointing towards  
the entrance door to the dome.  
  
  
*the nitrogen feedline was removed and the pipe nipple was unscrewed from  
the lens cell.  
  
  
*the three desiccant cells (silica gel) were removed by unscrewing them.  
  
  
*the hinge pin from the dew cover actuating rod was removed.  
  
  
*the three counterweights from the eyepiece end of the tube were removed  
and placed on the bar at the objective end of the tube in order to roughly  
rebalance the tube for when the lens cell and dew cover assembly are  
removed.  
SAFETY NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT ALL COUNTERWEIGHT SCREWS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED  
WITH A WRENCH AT ALL TIMES AS A COUNTERWEIGHT FALLING FROM ANY HEIGHT COULD  
CAUSE CONSIDERABLE INJURY TO PERSONNEL AND THE RESULTANT IMBALANCE COULD  
ALSO LEAD TO DAMAGE TO THE ARTEFACT SHOULD IT BE ALLOWED TO SWING UNCHECKED  
IN THIS CONDITION.  
  
  
*As a precaution, it is wise to tie the tube off to some immobile object  
when performing such operations as rearranging the counterweights so that  
the tube is under control at all times.  
  
  
*Before removing the dew cover, the orientation of the cover to the tube  
was marked so that proper reassembly is facilitated. the six pan-head  
screws were removed and the dew cover was wiggled away from the tube.  
  
  
*Three Allen head cap screws were now visible (these take a 5/16" Allen  
key). These fasten the lens cell to the telescope tube. They would be  
removed at a subsequent stage. They pass through the centres of three bolts  
that are locked in position with nuts. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES  
UNLOCK THESE NUTS AS THIS WILL ALTER THE ALIGNMENT OF THE LENS CELL WITH  
THE TUBE. the lens cell can be removed and replaced, without affecting  
alignment, by simply removing the three Allen head cap screws alone.  
  
  
*In preparation for removing the lens cell, the tube was swung down until  
the eyepiece now pointed to the zenith (directly overhead). The tube was  
tied off securely to the telescope pedestal. In this position, the exposed  
end of the tube is about 4" away from the floor. Once again, the  
orientation of the tube to the lens cell was marked so that reassembly  
would be facilitated. A piece of polyethylene sheeting should be placed on  
the carpeted floor at this stage (although it was overlooked on this  
occasion) to permit easy removal of the lens cell from under the telescope  
tube. Plywood sheeting was layered under the tube to take up most of the  
gap to the floor. A sheet of polyethylene was put on top of the wood and a  
thin layer of poly foam was placed on top of this to cushion the lens cell  
when lowered. THE LENS CELL WEIGHS APPROXIMATELY 80 LBS. SO CARE MUST BE  
EXERCISED WHEN REMOVING AND HANDLING IT. the lens cell was removed as next  
described but a potentially better method is subsequently outlined.  
  
  
*Large slot screw drivers were wedged in between the layers of plywood and  
by pressing down upon them the upper layers of plywood were levered into  
contact with the lens cell. At this point, the three Allen head cap screws  
were loosened off and removed and then the pressure was removed from the  
screwdrivers lowering the lens cell onto the plywood packing.  
AN ALTERNATE METHOD TO REMOVE THE LENS CELL (AND POTENTIALLY BETTER) WOULD  
BE TO MAKE UP THREE STUDS WITH THE SAME THREAD SIZE AS THE ALLEN HEAD CAP  
SCREWS. THESE STUDS WOULD BE OF LONGER  LENGTH THAN THE ORIGINAL BOLTS AND  
COULD INDIVIDUALLY REPLACE EACH OF THE BOLTS. NUTS WOULD BE APPLIED TO THE  
STUDS AND THEN THE NUTS COULD GRADUALLY BE UN-THREADED ON EACH STUD IN  
PROPER SEQUENCE SO AS TO GRADUALLY LOWER THE LENS CELL TO THE PLYWOOD  
PACKING IN A CONTROLLED FASHION. THIS OPERATION COULD BE PERFORMED BY ONE  
PERSON AND THE REVERSE OPERATION COULD BE DONE IN A SIMILAR FASHION.  
the lens cell was then slid out from underneath the tube for cleaning.  
  
  
*the back surface of the lens cell was cleaned with cotton balls dipped in  
methyl hydrate (methanol). The surface was rubbed very gently at first  
until the cotton balls showed little trace of removed grime. Progress was  
monitored by shining a light across the lens surface at a shallow angle in  
order to highlight the contamination. Final cleaning was done with soft,  
lint-free paper.  
  
  
*the lens cell was then replaced and secured with the three Allen head cap  
screws. the lens cell was raised into position by levering between the  
plywood layers with the screwdrivers. Once secure the tube was untied and  
swung back to shoulder height and then tied off again.  
  
  
*In this position, the exterior surface of the lens cell was similarly  
cleaned. It was obviously the dirtier of the two surfaces.  
  
  
*the mating surfaces for the dew cap were cleaned with Scotchbrite and then  
lubricated with a very light coat of lithium grease in order to facilitate  
installation of the dew cap. the dew cap was reattached and secured. the  
nitrogen fittings and supply line were reattached, as was the dew cap  
actuating linkage. the three desiccant cells were replaced and the tube  
counterweights were returned to their standard positions and secured.  
  
  
*At this point, the tube was freshly purged with nitrogen and normal  
service checks performed.  
  
  
*the alignment of the lens cell will be verified during subsequent  
operation.

CR_Text= During the course of routine inspection, 12/01/98, the declination  
wedge-locking mechanism was found to be virtually stalled out. Sluggish  
initial action of this mechanism has been a recurring problem throughout  
the recorded history of this artefact. Previous condition reports have  
speculated on the contributing factors to this problem and some solutions  
have been offered. Because the problem is largely weather dependent and is  
a relatively Minor frustration (at worst), no corrective action has been  
taken to date. Once again the current problem appears to be largely weather  
related. It was reasonably cold on the above date. Some condensation may  
get on the lead screw at times like this and also the lubricant will become  
more viscous. Due to the recent storm, the telescope has not been used for  
at least a week or more and the inactivity is most likely contributing to  
the problem as well.  
  
  
the mechanism was checked again the following day, 13/01/98, and had  
returned to its "normal"  pattern of operation, confirming that the problem  
is definitely related to cold weather. the opportunity was taken to  
exercise the locking mechanism and it was cycled through its range of  
travel at least a dozen times. the mechanism was steadied closely to  
pin-point the problem more accurately. the right-ascension locking  
mechanism was then operated in unison with that for the declination and it  
was interesting to find that once exercised, the two mechanisms operated at  
almost identical speeds. If anything, the declination wedge-locking system  
is slightly faster than that of the right-ascension. This would seem to  
eliminate the gearbox/motor unit as a source of the problem. the fit of the  
lead screws and nuts was checked and there is a large difference here. the  
fit of the right-ascension components is quite loose, while that of the  
declination system is quite snug, to the point that play can only just be  
discerned. the great difference is most likely due to the more frequent use  
of  the right-ascension mechanism during normal operation.  
  
  
As there is no accommodation for changing distance between the lead screw  
and the locking lever pivot point during the traversing motion (rigid  
mounting and solid components), the tighter fit and lack of flexibility  
could easily cause the sluggish action observed when the temperature drops.  
  
  
There would appear to be a very simple solution that would avoid previously  
suggested treatment and that is to simply interchange the nuts between lead  
screws. They should be interchangeable and this would allow the wear to  
even out without taking more drastic action such as re-machining the lead  
screw or nut. There is nothing to lose by trying this as the treatment is  
easily reversed. This will probably transfer the "sluggish" action to the  
right-ascension locking mechanism for a while but this should be  
self-correcting as it wears in.  
  
  
If the problem should not disappear after a break-in period, other  
solutions can then be tried. It has been noted that the mounting position  
of both motors is less than ideal and the previously suggested remedy still  
applies. However, In would hold off on doing anything else until after  
trying the swap.  
  
  
In don't think any disassembly is required, other than to back off the  
gambolling yoke pivot screws to allow the lead screw nuts to be removed.  
However, the necessary steps will be taken to effect the transfer.  
Amendment Jan 22,1998 Dave Elliott  
  
  
the sluggish action of the declination wedge locking mechanism was  
investigated by myself and volunteer , Lyness Jones. the pivot screws were  
removed from the yoke surrounding the lead screw nut, allowing it to be  
removed. Upon removing the yoke, the nut was found to have much increased  
freedom on the lead screw, very similar to that of the other wedge locking  
system. the nut can actually be "rattled" on the lead screw so there is  
definitely sufficient clearance in the fit of the lead screw and its nut.  
Upon reassembling the yoke, the freedom of  motion was once more reduced to  
the very limited amount of play that was observed initially. This would  
lead one to believe that the "combined" lack of freedom is due primarily to  
alignment problems, either the pivot screws or the motor/gearbox  
positioning. the locking system was exercised a number of times and, as  
reported before, operated quite normally after the first complete cycle of  
operation. the temperature was reasonably low over night and the machinery  
had a good cold soak so it is reasonable to assume that the current  
condition is representative of the more extreme conditions that will be  
experienced. We decided not to interchange the lead screw nuts. the system  
is fully operational and shows no indication of worsening. We will,  
however, remove and disassemble the offending gearbox/motor unit when the  
weather warms up. We will inspect the bearings and inspect and clean the  
attached gearbox. Depending upon what we find, we may also change to a  
lubricant suitable for colder  operating conditions.  
  
  
During the investigation, it was discovered that the locking mechanism's  
linkage does in fact accommodate the changing distance between the locking  
lever's axis of rotation and the lead screw. the yoke slides on the lever  
arm. It is not splined in any way (not necessary) and there seemed to be  
adequate freedom in the sliding fit. In don't think that this is  
contributing in anyway to binding of the linkage.  
  
  
When the gearbox/motor unit is removed for inspection, the opportunity can  
be taken to see if it can be aligned better when it is reinstalled and the  
pivot screws can also be checked for alignment.

TP_Date=01/14/1998  
TP_Text= In response to the condition report of 14/01/98, reporting the  
latest incident of the recurring problem with the "sluggish" declination  
wedge-locking mechanism, the following treatment is proposed:  
  
  
*  Interchange the leadscrew nuts between the two wedge-locking  
motor/gearbox units. This should require only that the gimballing yoke  
pivot screws be backed off and the nuts treaded up and off the leadscrews  
by hand. If further steps must be taken, treatment shall be restricted to  
that which does not alter the artefact in any way.  
  
  
*  Clean and relubricate the leadscrews and leadscrew nuts with lithium  
grease.  
  
  
*  Evaluate the new "fit" of the interchanged components and test the  
locking mechanisms to see if further action is necessary. The mechanisms  
shall be checked in significantly reduced temperatures as well (as  
available). *  It may be necessary to make slight adjustments on the travel  
of the wedge levers with the micro-switch contact arms. This will be done  
as necessary, based  upon observation of the locking performance of the  
wedges and also the freedom of motion, when released.  
  
  
It is proposed that volunteer, Lyness Jones, undertake this work. As you  
know, he is both sensitive to the delicate nature of the artefact and  
highly skilled in this type of work. Lyness is giving us one day a week,  
sometimes two, at this time. I will approach him about doing this work the  
next time he is in (I expect that will be next week) and then I would get  
him to do it on the first day that the weather permirs. If for any reason,  
he wishes to decline to undertake this task, I will proceed with the  
repairs myself.

Telescope:  
  
  
There have been no recent reports of problems with the telescope. Looking  
back through the dossier, however, a number of outstanding problems can be  
identified. A service request was submitted 22/06/94 by Randall Brooks to  
have the finder telescope aligned with the main instrument. At the time,  
the task was postponed until such time as the weather complied and Michel  
Labrecque was available for assistance. Scheduling was left up to Michel  
and the matter seems to have been forgotten. In presume the problem was not  
too serious as operations have continued since then without further  
comment.  Never-the-less, if the matter was worthwhile doing in 1994, it  
should still be worthwhile doing today.  
  
  
A greater problem has been the ongoing sluggish action of the declination  
wedge-locking motor during the colder weather. the problem has been  
investigated several times but a solution has yet to be achieved. the  
problem was last reported upon 22/01/98. the suggestions mentioned then  
should be acted on as it persists.  
  
  
Due to the dome leaking for a number of years, the telescope has had to be  
covered with plastic sheeting when not in use. On several occasions, there  
was Minor water damage (surface rusting of exposed metal surfaces) that was  
treated in a temporary fashion. A more thorough cleanup could be done but  
this only makes sense if we solve the roof leakage problems first. Apart  
from the above, the telescope could benefit from normal cleaning and  
maintenance.  
  
  
Dome:  
  
  
I'm not sure where matters stand with the dome leakage problem but the  
matter should be resolved once and for  all. There has been plastic  
covering the telescope for at least two years now and there doesn't seem to  
be a solution in sight. This detracts significantly from an otherwise very  
good exhibit. Immediate action is required to resolve the matter.  
  
  
There are a number of places on the inside of the upper dome surfaces where  
the paint is peeling. These need to be touched up. In don't think there is  
any need to redo the entire dome.  
  
  
I've heard rumour that the vestibule may be replaced entirely. If not, the  
present one needs to be repainted externally and there are large gaps on  
both sides at ground level that need to be closed to prevent animals and  
the weather from entering.  
  
  
the telescope is inspected and attended to regularly by Conservation staff.  
the rest of the facility is the responsibility of Facilities Management and  
work may be taken care of by SAT staff or by contract. It might be  
worthwhile to review the maintenance schedule of the dome to see if it is  
deemed adequate for there  are times that the housekeeping is definitely  
lacking. the care and maintenance of the battery backup system for the dome  
shutter should also be checked. the battery may be getting regular  
attention from SAT electrical staff on a regular basis but In have no  
evidence to suggest that.

gearbox mounting and aslo disassembling the gearbox unit, removing the old  
lubricant and replacing with fresh of either the same grade or lighter as  
deemed necessary. Should the problem persist, a replacement gearbox/motor  
unit will be searched for and installed. SAT Electronics Division staff  
will be consulted for advice on this matter, due to their greater  
experience in this area.  
  
  
*  Do thorough cleaning of artefact once roof leakage problems are known to  
be corrected.  
  
  
*  Do normal maintenance (inspection, cleaning and lubrication).  
  
  
  
  
In addition, approach Facilities Management to:

CR_Text= the sluggish response of the declination wedge locking motor has  
been reported on many times in the past. A number of theories have been put  
forth as to the cause of the problem. In spoke to Ian Christopher this  
morning while we were both in the dome doing service work and he suggests  
that the cause may be the starting capacitor on the motor. It may be  
defective and not giving the motor enough assistance in starting which  
would become more noticeable as the weather gets colder. This sounds  
plausible. He suggests removing the capacitors from both wedge locking  
motors and testing them in the electronics shop. They can be compared to  
each other and against their specifications. They can also subject them to  
cold temperatures and see how they react. If one or both prove to have  
problems, they would be replaced. the capacitors themselves are housed  
inside the canisters that one sees mounted to the telescope. the canister  
for the troublesome capacitor has some dents, the cause of which is  
unknown. Perhaps it has been physically damaged in the past by a source  
unknown and this has contributed to its problems. As an additional note, a  
problem was detected with the primary dome shutter control. the emergency  
stopping switch is not working. Jerry Hubbel will investigate and make  
repairs. the backup power battery for the shutter is also being serviced.  
It was not working. If necessary, it will be replaced. the second backup  
for closing the shutter, if powered modes fail, is to crank it closed. In  
have never seen a crank. It should be a simple affair consisting of a long  
shaft that can reach the top of the dome with a hook on the end and a crank  
on the opposite end. A search should be made to find it if it exists. If it  
is missing, one should be fabricated and left in the dome.

TP_Text= The following treatment is proposed to resolve the sluggish action  
of the declination wedge locking motor (see condition report 28/04/00):  
*  Remove the starting capacitors from both wedge locking motors  
(declination and right ascension) and test them in SAT electronics lab to  
see if they meet their specifications, how they compare to each other and  
to see if their performance is significantly lowered when subjected to  
cold. If one or both prove to be substandard, they will be replaced with  
new components of appropriate value. Replacement components may require  
fabrication of suitable mounting attachments to install. Such mounts will  
be fashioned in such a way that they do not alter any components original  
to the artefact. The treatment will be carried out by qualified SAT  
electronics and electrical staff. Defective capictors will be retained if  
replaced and will be turned over to Conservation staff for storage. The  
repairs will be conducted during daytime and the telescope will be  left  
serviceable for evening programs at all times.

CR_Date=02/25/2004  
CR_Text= There have been further complaints in recent times of the  
historical problem of positive engagement and dis-engagement of the R.A.  
locking mechanism. the problem has been documented before and basically  
occurs due to the modifications that were made to the original locking  
mechanism to make it more convenient for operators by motorizing the  
locking action. the original locking mechanism was activated by a system of  
shafting that included two universal joints and transferred the locking  
motion from a point external to the locking yoke framework. We do not have  
a complete set of drawings to illustrate all aspects of the original  
mechanism but one can deduce what the missing components must have been  
like. the main virtue of the original system appears to be that there was  
no limit to the range of the locking motion. the wedge could be tightened  
or loosened as much as was required to achieve both positive engagement and  
free travel when not engaged. the motorized conversion was not  thought out  
very well and its compact arrangement has led to problems with adequate  
range of travel to ensure positive wedge locking action. the problem is  
that the locking mechanism lever is positioned between the declination axis  
casting and the R.A. locking mechanism/slewing action yoke. This space is  
tight and limits the rotary action of the locking mechanism to about 10  
degrees of travel. This borders on being insufficient to achieve proper  
action for both locking and unlocking. To compound the problem, the locking  
wedge wears on its faces over time and the reference point for engagement  
changes. the only way that we presently have to correct the problem is to  
physically bend the locking lever. This is a crude way to correct the  
problem and is damaging to the lever over time. Harvey Ballard disassembled  
the R.A. yoke mechanism in 1992 and made some repairs/adjustments to the  
locking wedge and then replaced the yoke and freshly lubricated the  
mechanism. This appears to have corrected things at that time. Harvey had  
predicted that this operation might have to be done as often as every two  
years depending upon amount of use. Fortunately, that has not been the case  
but In think it is time to do this service again now. In did a test on Feb.  
24, 2004 to determine if the locking mechanism is still capable of positive  
engagement and conclude that it needs work. the test involved detaching the  
locking lever from the driving motor and then attempting to manually lock  
the wedge with the lever. the wedge could still be locked but the action  
was not positive and distinct and it took a surprising amount of  
force/effort to achieve positive engagement. Harvey recorded that the faces  
of the wedges had become scored in 1992 and that the accumulated wear had  
allowed the inner face of the wedge to interfere with the bottom of the  
corresponding wedge groove. This prevented the wedge from locking  
adequately, no matter how much pressure was applied. It appears that this  
may be occurring again and the only way to find out is to take things apart  
again. In propose that this be done, the wedge be dressed to smooth its  
faces, the inner face be reduced sufficiently to provide the necessary  
clearance to allow positive locking (plus some extra to account for further  
wear) and that fresh lubrication be applied upon reassembly. the locking  
action should then be tested and adjusted. More involved modifications can  
be contemplated, if this treatment does not prove adequate (most likely a  
return to a system similar to the original manual one but with motorized  
operation).

TR_Text= 30/09/2003 In response to the trouble report of 09/29/2003 (Michel  
2 hrs Labrecque), concerning RA tracking and balance problems, the DEE  
following treatment was undertaken:  
  
  
*the operating lever and heim joint were removed from the RA wedge locking  
mechanism for repair and adjustment. Note: It is necessary to locate the  
appropriate breaker in the electrical panel to disable the RA wedge locking  
motor during servicing. There is power to the motor even when the key is  
not in the control panel and it will drive in one direction continuously  
with no way to stop it. This can cause jamming problems with the linkage  
and motor unless the power is switched off at the panel.  
  
  
*These components were a later addition installed while the telescope was  
installed at the Dominion Observatory. the lever has been bent on several  
occasions to adjust its range of control. For some reason, there were  
numerous scores in the shaft and these interfered with removal of the shaft  
from the telescope as the  shaft would not slide through the securing  
fixture on the wedge locking shaft, nor through the sleeve of the heim  
joint. Eventually , removal was achieved.  
  
  
*All scoring was removed from the lever. the lever had been crudely painted  
(in place) after installation and this paint also contributed to the  
problems with removal. the paint was removed with Agra-shell and the shaft  
was polished with fine sandpaper and oil. the sleeve of the heim joint was  
cleaned with the appropriate reamer and the hole was chamfered lightly. the  
lever shaft now slides nicely through the sleeve.  
  
  
*Inspection of the lever shape before adjustment suggested that the lever  
needed to have some bend removed. It was decided that about half of the  
bend would be removed as a first adjustment and then the tracking would be  
tested before further adjustments. This was done. the lever bends easily if  
installed in the lathe chuck and then is hit lightly with the rubber mallet  
(no scores...thank you).  
  
  
*the lever and heim joint were degreased and then reinstalled on the  
telescope. the sleeve of the joint was given a light coat of LPS 2  
lubricant, as were the pivot pins in the joint yoke. the wedge motor lead  
screw was freshly lubed with lithium grease.  
  
  
*Testing indicated that the first adjustment was successful. the locking  
action is much more positive and probably about as good as can be expected  
with the limitations for adjustment of the current set up. No further  
adjustment seems necessary.  
  
  
*the balance of the telescope was checked and was found to be reasonable. I  
informed Michel Labrecque of this and suggested that a regular operator get  
together with me some time at the telescope so that we could make any  
adjustments together. If the required adjustment is only very slight, I  
suspect that it would take actual observations through the telescope to  
note any actual drifting in declination. Michel will let me know if he  
wants to pursue this action.  
TP_Text= With reference to the condition report of 02/25/2004, the  
following treatment is proposed:  
  
  
*  detach R.A.wedge locking motor and temporarily suspend from telescope  
(detach completely, if necessary)  
*  disassemble R.A. locking/slewing yoke in order to remove locking wedge  
for examination and service  
*  clean wedge groove on polar axis thoroughly with varsol and check for  
signs of damage; smooth as necessary with files and sandpaper  
*  examine wedge for signs of wear and roughness on wedge faces; smooth as  
necessary; insert repaired wedge in groove and check for adequate  
relief/clearance at root of groove; remove sufficient material from inner  
face of wedge to provide at least .005-.010" root clearance  
*  remove lead screw from yoke body and examine for damage; dress  
accordingly *  clean all yoke components and leadscrew thoroughly in varsol  
bath *  Reassemble yoke assmbly, applying fresh lubricant (speak to harvey  
Ballard for his thoughts on what lubricant and what amounts would be  
appropriate based on his past experience). It appears that the yoke  
presently has been lubricated with chassis grease through a fitting on the  
yoke cap. We may have to experiment a little bit to see what works best.  
*  reinstall R.A. wedge locking motor assembly  
*  reattach locking lever to wedge locking motor assembly; adjust lever as  
necessary to achieve satisfactory locking/unlocking  
*  optional: While the yoke is apart, it might be a good idea to make an  
alternate leadscrew that can possibly be used in a modified version of the  
locking mechanism. I have a few ideas as to ways to make the locking  
mechanism adjustable (externally) and it would be a good opportunity to  
make the leadscrew while the yoke is apart and the leadscrew can be fitted  
to it. I will have to see whether or not the leadscrew can be removed  
without taking the yoke apart again. The frame configuration may not permit  
this but if it can, then a future modification would be quite straight  
forward.  
I expect that two  full days are required to do this treatment. Scheduling  
should be co-ordinated with Michel Labrecque. Recent adjustments may be  
sufficient to put this service off until warmer weather but approval is  
sought at this time to avoid future delays.

- Recent work on the RA tracking problem provided a reminder that Oct.4 the  
telescope was in need of its annual maintenance. the 10 hrs following  
treatment was done using following the usual DEE procedures:  
  
  
*the dome shutter was partially opened to provide better lighting to work  
by and this revealed the poor state of general housekeeping of the dome  
enclosure itself. It was decided that the lower portion of the dome should  
be cleaned up before proceeding to the telescope so that any subsequent  
cleaning of the dome would not transfer dust to the telescope  
unnecessarily. the cleaning involved removing a heavy accumulation of  
cobwebs from around the circular track upon which the dome revolves, the  
two drive motor assemblies and the lower portions of the fixed base walls.  
the electrical panels and storage cupboards were also vacuumed and brushed  
out. Some loose wiring was tidied up with tie-wraps and extra supplies were  
also tidied up.  
  
  
*During the clean up, it was noted that  many of the wall panels were  
warping and a good number of fasteners were working loose due presumably to  
high humidity in the building at times and also the wide swings in the  
interior temperature. All loose fasteners were hammered home but the panels  
could be better secured with screws. I will contact facilities about this  
problem and also about improving the housekeeping of the dome proper. No  
attempt was made to clean above about three feet above the track. the upper  
dome remains to be cleaned. Fortunately, the upper reaches of the dome do  
not appear to attract the cobwebs to the same degree as the lower regions.  
It could also benefit from some touch up to the flat black paint and the  
shutter motor should also be serviced. I will mention this to facilities  
also.  
  
  
*the rolling stairwells and viewing stand were also vacuumed and wiped down  
and repairs were made to the restraining rope on the viewing stand.  
  
  
*the floor carpeting was vacuumed. the under floor areas were inspected but  
no cleaning was done in these areas at this time.  
  
  
*the telescope was vacuumed and brushed down in entirety. There were  
isolated areas where it appears some excess lubrication had either dropped  
or sprayed onto the tube. These spots were removed with a rag dampened with  
alcohol. There appeared no need to wipe down the entire tube as a test  
patch did not show any significant improvement.  
  
  
*the upper lens cavity was carefully vacuumed out with the aid of soft  
brushes and a low pressure air duster purchased for this purpose. the outer  
surface of the three piece objective lens assembly has a noticeable amount  
of grime on it. There hasn't been any recent requests for cleaning of the  
lens but it was last cleaned properly in 1997, at which time Jacques  
Labrecque was present to supervise operations and Lyness Jones was also  
present to provide his able assistance. I did not attempt to clean the lens  
at this time but will contact Michel Labrecque and Randall Brooks to find  
out what they  recommend doing in this respect.  
  
  
*the desiccant was replaced in the three canisters attached to the  
objective lens assembly.  
  
  
*All excess lubricant was removed from the tracking drive assembly, the  
telescope pier and the wedge locking and slewing assemblies on the  
telescope tube. Significant excesses were also removed from gear trains but  
in large part the lithium grease that was on the gear teeth was left in  
place and fresh lubricant was added as necessary. This was done because the  
existing lubricant was still soft and serviceable in most cases and removal  
would be very time consuming due to lack of access to the gear train. Fresh  
lithium grease had been purchased for application of a fresh coat of  
lubrication but it was found to differ greatly from that used in the past  
in that it was very thin with a greater proportion of solvent. It was not  
very user friendly but was applied by spraying it into the aerosol lid  
first and then transferring it to the gear teeth by brush. A  different  
brand of grease will have to be acquired that is more appropriate for our  
needs. I will pursue this. the gears on the synchronous motor differential  
assembly were given a few drops of Tellus 32 oil only.  
All greasing points on the telescope pier and the wedge locking and slewing  
assemblies were lightly greased with chassis grease using the temporary  
grease fittings found in the telescope maintenance kit. Some grease points  
were found to grease easily with obvious signs of grease passage. Others  
were rather inconclusive. I don't think that the old grease has necessarily  
gone hard but the bearing/housing clearances may be such that ready passage  
and observation of the grease should not be expected. the telescope  
manoeuvres freely so there does not appear to be any problem at present. A  
light coating of grease was also applied externally to the faces of the  
auxiliary support rollers at the top of the pier.  
All bearings for the shafting of the drive mechanism in the pier were  
lubricated lightly with Tellus 32 oil. Fresh lithium grease was applied to  
the lead screws of the wedge locking motors and LPS 2 grease was lightly  
applied to the pivot pins on the heim joints of the wedge locking  
mechanisms.  
  
  
*the eyepiece mount was sufficiently tight and was not adjusted. the  
focussing mechanism was lightly cleaned with alcohol and runs smoothly.  
  
  
*Some loose wires around the wedge locking assemblies were tied up with  
additional tie-wraps.  
  
  
*the normal weekly tests were conducted for all systems and everything  
appears to be in order. the recent adjustments to the RA wedge locking  
mechanism appear to have been successful. the nitrogen tank is still  
serviceable and there is a small store of spare light bulbs (assorted) in  
the storage cupboards. the service caddy was cleaned out and restocked and  
is in the Conservation lock up at 1867.  
  
  
*All garbage was removed from the dome.  
  
  
*Treatment documented.

CR_Text= It has been reported (03/24/2004) that the joint overlapping strip  
on the shutter of the telescope is loose and missing at least one screw.  
the problem was checked out and this is indeed the case. the strip is made  
of aluminum and attached to one of the shutter halves with four (4) steel,  
round head, 6-32 UNF machine screws. Three of the four screws have sheared  
their heads off (cause unknown). The shanks are still embedded in the  
shutter and backing strip and will have to be drilled out and retaped. the  
overlapping strip has been removed temporarily and is in the office of  
David Elliott, along with the remaining attachment screw. It is not  
essential to operation. Originally it served to keep the weather away from  
the objective lens when the telescope was not in use. We now place a vinyl  
cover over the end of the telescope when it is not in use and this does the  
same thing, only better. In any case, it would be advisable to replace the  
damaged screws and strip.  
  
  
It was noticed that  there is some corrosion on components in and around  
the shutter assembly. the paint has also been compromised in a number of  
areas. At some point, dust seals have been fabricated from what looks like  
a product available from Spae-Naur. They make foam rubber stripping in  
different densities and with a self-adhering backing. This foam has been  
placed on the flanged end of the tube so that the shutter halves seal  
against when closed. the same has been done on the shutter joint. Each  
shutter half has a light, aluminum angle rivetted to its underside. the  
half with the overlapping strip (now removed) has a strip of the foam on  
the vertical face of this angle to provide a seal across the diameter of  
the tube at the joint of the shutters. All of this foam has deteriorated to  
the point that it is contributing little to weather tightness. It should  
all be replaced and the Minor corrosion problems and paint loss should also  
be addressed. In would suggest that these tasks be done during the  annual  
maintenance normally done in June.  
TP_By=Dave Elliott  
TP_Date=03/24/2004  
TP_Text= Based upon the condition report of 03/24/2004, the following  
treatment is proposed:  
  
  
*  drill out three remaining shutter overlap strip mounting screws and  
retap holes (6-32UNF).  
*  remove loose paint from overlapping strip (as necessary...light  
compressed-air) to ensure that the piece fits back on the shutter properly;  
reattach with all new 6-32 UNF by 1/2", round head, steel machine screws. *  
remove the remains of all weather stripping applied to the tube end flange  
and the shutter joint flanges.  
*  prepare the sealing surfaces to receive new sealing material by removing  
loose paint and old adhesive by mechanical means and application of  
solvents (as necessary).  
*  purchase new weather stripping seal material from Spae-Naur in the  
appropriate sizes and apply as per existing pattern.  
*  remove minor corrosion from shutter components by mechanical means. *  
touch up paint on shutter components with matching paint.  
These tasks can be scheduled to be done along with normal annual  maintence  
tasks (probably June 2004). The extra work should take aboutfour hours.

following information is provided for record purposes as it relates to the  
artefact.  
  
  
Item #3, of Internal Service Request #C04-067, requests that some  
additional signage or indicators be added to the existing indicator lights  
on the Warner- Swasey telescope that inform an operator as to the status of  
the locking wedges for both declination and right-ascension. the reason for  
the request is that a new telescope operator has been tested and approved  
to use the telescope but happens to be colour blind and has difficulty  
differentiating between the red and amber lights. the request suggested the  
possibility of adding another indicator in close proximity to the lights  
which happen to be high up on the telescope in the vicinity of the wedge  
locking mechanisms. To avoid complication and possible changes to the  
artefact, In would suggest that the Graphic Design people in Technical  
Services simply produce a small, laminated  graphic panel that can be  
attached to the control box on the lower, viewing end of the telescope. the  
panel should contain a labelled diagram of the indicator lights as they  
appear to the viewer, indicating what each one signifies, not by colour but  
by illumination intensity. If the panel is attached to the control box it  
is close at hand to the operator and should also be in the same field of  
view as the indicator lights under all viewing conditions. In presume that  
the affected operator can distinguish between an illuminated bulb and one  
that is not, regardless of colour. the graphic panel can be made from  
laminated card stock and will not weigh very much. It can be attached to  
the control box with double sided tape.

following treatment is proposed:  
  
  
*  Produce a work order for the Graphic Design section of Technical  
Services that clearly outlines what is required in the way of an additional  
graphic panel to be attached to the wedge locking control panel on the  
lower end of the tube of the Warner-Swasey telescope. The work order should  
include a sketch and indicate how the panel shall be attached to the  
control box. Installation shall be left to conservation staff.  
  
  
*  Install when ready.  
  
  
Note: The work order should be sent to Bruce malanka via Sue Boileau..
