An upbound trip ...  

  

" At Carillon the steamer's course is once more barred by rapids, to avoid which a canal has been constructed ; but passengers by the mail-boat land at Carillon and take [the] train to Grenville, a distance of twelve miles, whence another steamer proceeds without farther interruption to Ottawa. Opposite Carillon, at Point Fortune, the river becomes the boundary line between the two Provinces. At the Chute au Blondeau is another canal an eighth of a mile in length and a dam has here been thrown across the river, which so pens back the waters that only a passage of three-quarters of a mile in length is now needed to reach the higher level above the chute. Beside the Long Sault Rapid is the Grenville Canal, excavated for the most part through solid rock, and leading to the village of Grenville, a distance of six miles. These three canals were constructed, like that of the Rideau, by the Imperial Government for military purposes. Happily, there is no prospect of their being needed for such ;Â  and even should necessity arise, their usefulness is a thing of the past, superseded, as they now are, by the opening of the St. Lawrence Canals and the Grand Trunk Railway on the front, as well as by the new lines of railway to the north, which make our intercommunication secure from any foe. Down these three rapids - the Carillon, Long Sault, and Chute au Blondeau - the lumbermen descend on their cribs of timber. Formidable as this feat looks, it is frequently accomplished by travellers who adventure in company with the raftsmen, and seldom suffer worse consequences than a wetting."

The locomotive 'wheel arrangement' (the number of driving and unpowered wheels) of the original locomotives had been altered ... but the gauge of the C&G engines was still their original 'Provincial Gauge' at 5 feet 6 inches ... 17% wider than the Standard Gauge used almost everywhere else then and now.
