- Ask Emily about whether or not we want to give them the option to see artifacts in their choice of order, or if they should follow a predetermined path
- Ask if they want theoretical grounding for the project too?
- ask for feedback on the experience so far
- ask about interview contact process (share ideas on how who to ask and how to best do so)



Make the topic/theme:
- a day in the life of an artifact; what would they have heard? what sounds did they make? plus featured interviews
