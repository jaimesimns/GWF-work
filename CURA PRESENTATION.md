Hi everyone! My name is Jaime,

The project I'm working on is an audio-based exploration of the oversized collection room, which I've done using Twine. 

It focuses on eight artifacts
CCF-Brill T44 trolleybus (#4042), Montreal 1937 to 1966
Carmichael & Brown combination car, built 1854, served on the Grenville-Carillon railway
Bucyrus-Erie powershovel, used in Renfrew, ON from the 1920s to the 60s
Helen Sawyer Hogg observatory telescope
an Ontario Hydro A/C generator
Sawyer-Massey thresher from 1902, used in Cumberland, ON
Cochburn Pointer boat, used near Portage du Fort on the Ottawa River, built 1900ish
Little giant bale elevator, used on a christmas tree farm in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia

My project is still in progress, but I figured I'd show you what I've got so far.

So just for some background,
So, this is Twine - it's a text-based open-source interactive story creator, and one of its versions allows you to edit its javascript and css, to basically make it be whatever you want.

For my project, I used the javascript function to make the tour geolocated - so that the stops only appear if you're in front of the artifact, which encourages folks to come to the collection room to use it. I also built in a by-pass of that though so that the tour can also be accessed from anywhere.

Each artifact will have a soundscape based on some aspect of their life as well as interviews with various knowledge holders, including some of you as curators, an artifact handler/conservator also from Ingenium, and community members who have experience with the artifact during its working history.

Each artifact also have a short history written, taken from catalogue notes and also external research.

So now, I will show you my project as it currently stands.

- the tour will be available in both English and French, though I have more of the English done, and my French will definitely need some editing.

The tour starts with the trolleybus, which is the first artifact that you come across from the entrance of the collection room. For the soundscape, I decided to go kind of with 'a day in the life' theme, to try to recreate a spatial sense of the trolleybus route through sounds that the trolleybus might have heard on its daily commute
- to make the soundscape for the trolleybus, I dug into the montreal city archives and found old transit maps to recreate the 26 Beaubien route
- to figure out key buildings along the route, I found every archival photo that I could of rue Beaubien around the 50s from the Quebec provincial archive, and pieced them together based on their location data, sort of photogrammetry style; from there and from city maps, I plotted out key buildings or locations that would have made fairly distinct noises in the 1950s
	- I chose two churches, a fire station, two parks, and then well-known Theatre Plaza as buildings that stood out in a mainly residential area; and I was able to find a photo of the plaza's marquee in 1955 showing that it was premiering "Son seul amour" (English title "One Desire") which was a Technicolour drama romance
- so I drew on those sounds, including a short audio clip from the film, and tried to find as accurate a representation as possible for those sounds and for the trolleybus sounds
		- a fun fact is in 1947 when the trolleybusses were sold, several of them were sold to Mexico City to continue their life, and I was able to find a sound of what might have been one of them, so it's the base layer of the soundscape, and then the other sounds are layered overtop, and all edited together with various effects in Audacity
		- And I mapped the audio length against the streetmap, which has about 54 blocks that it covers, and so it's about three seconds per city block, 
		- so when you listen to the soundscape, you can map out the geography as it goes along

And then from there, you go to the interviews page, where you can listen to everyone or just to someone, and then you have the option of reading a longer history or moving on.

Similar format for the combination car, though instead of focusing on the spatial dimension I focused on its temporality, and did about 1 second of audio per year of its life. The soundscape is broken down into four major sections, the first its life on the Grenville and Carillon railway, the second its journey across the ice, the third its time on the farm, with each decade featuring a different period-appropriate tractor noise, and then its time in the museum.

I've also written most of the history section, though I have some notes about narrow-gauge versus broad-gauge to add it, and that's about where I'm at.


Future steps:
- collecting recordings from everyone who's agreed to help (thank you to all of you who have agreed to help me out; I really appreciate it!)
- I need to continue working on outreach to community members
- finish writing the artifact histories/do the soundscapes, etc for the remaining six artifacts
- and then eventually do testing and all that good stuff

And that's where I'm at - thanks for listening!
